        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This project began with a user centered question: Why is it still so
          hard for students to find campus events, clubs, and opportunities?
          Information is often scattered shared through posters, emails, or
          group chats and itâ€™s easy to miss out. To solve this, I applied a UX
          first mindset: identify the user pain points, streamline access to
          information, and reduce friction in discovering student life. The
          result is a centralized, intuitive platform designed to connect
          students more easily with their campus and students communities.

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          To design a digital hub that can be continuesly improved to meet
          student needs and the student experience through thoughtful UX,
          accessibility, and clear, usable information architecture. Ultimately,
          this webstie aims to make campus involvement feel effortless and
          inclusive.

        <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
        <p>
          This project gave me the opportunity to combine my experience and
          technical development, UX research, wireframing, and iterative design.
          I conducted simple UX research, sketched low-fidelity, and
          refined the interface to match real user needs. The experience helped
          me think like a user, designer, not just a developer. Itâ€™s a project
          grounded in empathy, usability, and real world relevance.
